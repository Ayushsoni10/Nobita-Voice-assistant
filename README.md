# Nobita-Voice-assistant
This Python script appears to be a voice-activated assistant named “Nobita A.I” that uses the OpenAI API for text generation and the speech_recognition library for speech recognition. Here’s a breakdown of the main components:

Imports: The script imports several libraries, including speech_recognition for speech recognition, os for interacting with the operating system, webbrowser for opening web pages, and openai for using the OpenAI API.

Global Variables: The chatStr variable is used to store the conversation history between the user and Nobita A.I.

Functions:

chat(query): This function takes a user query as input, appends it to the conversation history, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns the generated response.
ai(prompt): This function sends a prompt to the OpenAI API and writes the generated response to a text file in the “Openai” directory.
say(text): This function uses the os.system command to convert text to speech.
takeCommand(): This function listens to the user’s voice command and returns it as text.
Main Program: In an infinite loop, the script listens for voice commands from the user and performs actions based on these commands. These actions include opening websites, playing music, telling time, opening applications, generating text using artificial intelligence, resetting chat history, and quitting the program.

Please note that this is a high-level explanation of the code. Each function and command has more specific operations that are performed within them. Also, please be aware that this script contains some hardcoded paths and commands that might need to be adjusted based on your specific system configuration. For example, paths to applications or files might differ on your machine.

Remember to replace apikey in the config import statement with your actual OpenAI API key before running this script. Always keep your API keys secure and do not expose them in public code repositories or other insecure locations.
